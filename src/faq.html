		How does homeopathy work?
		</summary>
		<p>Homeopathy works by gently stimulating the healing powers that every person naturally has.</p>
		<p>Think about when you cut yourself: The body automatically starts forming a clot and a scab and after a few days there is only a little scar left.</p>
		<p>The body can use the same healing mechanisms for any illness or symptom it develops. Only sometimes our bodies seem to forget what they are supposed to be doing, or they are &lsquo;stuck&rsquo; in the mode of being sick.</p>
		<p>Homeopathic remedies remind the body of its abilities of self-healing or &lsquo;shakes&rsquo; it out of its stuck place.</p>

		What are homeopathic remedies?
		</summary>
		<p>Homeopathic remedies (or medicines) are derived from natural sources, e.g. plants and minerals.</p>
		<p>In order to achieve a gentle action, the remedies are highly diluted. At the same time they are &ldquo;potentized&rdquo; through vigorous shaking. This potentization releases the remedies' energy. The higher the potentization, the more powerful the remedies become.</p>
		<p>This energy cannot be seen or measured with machines but it can be &ldquo;seen&rdquo; in its action against illness. It can be compared to radio waves: You cannot see them but your radio can receive them. In the same way your body can &lsquo;receive&rsquo; the energy of a remedy and you will &ldquo;see&rdquo; its action through the changes in your health.</p>
		<p>Homeopathic remedies are very safe and non-addictive. They do not cause harmful side-effects. They are completely safe to be taken during pregnancy for example and they can be taken safely alongside any other medication.</p>

		What about taking conventional medication?
		</summary>
		<p>Homeopathy works very well alongside any medication you might be taking. As your homeopath I will not tell you to stop any medication you have been prescribed. When your body becomes more able to look after itself during the course of the homeopathic treatment your need for the conventional medication may become less. Together with the prescribing doctor you should then discuss reducing the conventional medication.</p>

		Will I need to go on a special diet?
		</summary>
		<p>There is no need at all to change your diet unless, of course, you feel that the food you are eating is not doing you much good. As you are attempting to improve your health overall you might want to look into eating healthier food. I may make recommendations when I feel that the food you are eating is making you ill and I will provide advice if you want help.</p>
