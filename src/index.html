		<p>Homeopathy can help with all of the above and more. It is a holistic form of medicine that treats you as a &lsquo;whole&rsquo; person, not just the part of you that presents with symptoms.</p>

<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I started using homeopathy during my first pregnancy and with my newborn baby in 1998. Having experienced the gentle yet powerful changes in my child&rsquo;s health when the consultant said no more could be done made me look into this form of medicine more and more.</p>
<p>I studied at the Welsh School of Hom&oelig;opathy and received my Diploma and Licenciate in Homeopathy in 2005. I have been a registered member of the Society of Homeopaths since and work according to their Code of Ethics. I have full professional insurance and am committed to continuous professional development.</p>
<p>I run a face-to-face practice in Carmarthen in West Wales where I am based at the Welsh School of Hom&oelig;opathy.</p>
<p>I have been teaching first-aid, self-help, introductory and advanced courses in homeopathy since 2004. I am available to hold talks and workshops on homeopathy.</p>
