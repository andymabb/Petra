	<h2>Treatment of Fever</h2>
	<p>Coughs and colds have been making the rounds since the beginning of autumn, but for many the flu season does not seem to start until early in the New Year. Often it is your child that comes down with something, and it can be upsetting to watch a little one with fever and being generally unwell. This seasonal advice will help you to understand the purpose of a fever (as associated with flu or childhood illnesses for example).</p>
	<h3>Treatment of Fever</h3>
	<p>Paracetamol (or calpol for children) and ibuprofen (and aspirin before the warnings about damage to the digestive tract) are the first reaction of most people when faced with a fever. <q>Get the temperature down, quickly</q> &ndash; either from fear of what a raised temperature might do, or because work commitments need to be fulfilled. And paracetamol or ibuprofen usually does the trick. However, it doesn&rsquo;t support the immune system!</p>
	<p>I would like to explain the purpose of a fever and why it is important not to step in too soon.</p>
	<p>First of all, a normal body temperature is anything between 36.5&deg;C and 37.5&deg;C (97&deg;F &ndash; 99&deg;F). Normal body temperature varies between individuals and also at different times of the day (or days of the cycle for menstruating women). Anything above 37.5&deg;C (99&deg;F) can be classed as a fever, with temperatures of 40.5&deg;C (105&deg;F) and higher being critical.</p>
	<p>Different style fever thermometers give different accuracy: in the armpit gives a lower reading than in the mouth; forehead thermometers are widely acknowledged to be unreliable. Modern in-the-ear thermometers tend to give a quick and reliable reading and are especially useful for babies and small children. But be aware that the temperature on the side a child has been lying on may be reading too high. We even had a high temperature reading of Teddy&rsquo;s ear once &ndash; after he had been held tightly by my feverish daughter!</p>
	<p>Fever is a healthy reaction of the immune system, e.g. when faced with &lsquo;invaders&rsquo; like bacteria or viruses. The rise in body temperature is unfavourable to most germs and it speeds up the production of white blood cells and mobilises them to get to the site of an &lsquo;attack&rsquo; quickly. Usually pulse rate and breathing are increased; both help to provide more oxygen to the body quickly. It&rsquo;s like the body has entered a competition of who is going to win this race!</p>
	<p>Sometimes really healthy and robust individuals (most commonly children) throw the most dramatic fevers. This is usually a good sign &ndash; a sign that the body is in a really fit state to enter the competition and get rid of the &lsquo;attackers&rsquo; fast and furiously, i.e. win the race. For the same reason we don&rsquo;t often see hugely elevated temperatures in the elderly, because their overall constitutional state is often so weakened that their system can&rsquo;t be challenged too much. You don&rsquo;t see many 80-year-olds running in races!</p>
	<p>In most fever cases it is more important to check how the patient is coping than to worry about the actual temperature. In most healthy individuals (other than babies and very young children), a temperature of 40&deg;C (104&deg;F) can still be regarded as a &lsquo;healthy&rsquo; reaction, provided that the patient is conscious, reasonably alert and not in distress.</p>
	<p>Listlessness, excessive drowsiness, hallucinatory states, convulsions, obvious and distressing pain and respiratory difficulties are some of the key factors to indicate that the patient is not coping and needs treatment. This can be with a temperature of less than 39&deg;C (102&deg;F) or as high as 40.5&deg;C (105&deg;F)!</p>
	<p>Until then, common sense practical measures provide much more support to the fighting immune system than medication:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>plenty of fluids (preferably water or watered down fruit juice)</li>
		<li>light clothing (for babies: remove disposable nappy for at least some of the time)</li>
		<li>reducing room temperature (18&deg;C/65&deg;F is fine)</li>
		<li>sponging down the patient (with tepid water, one limb at a time)</li>
		<li>light food, if desired &ndash; avoid sugar and artificial or junk food because it doesn&rsquo;t provide nutrition to the body yet puts more stresses onto the system</li>
		<li>bed rest &ndash; maybe not as obvious any more in our modern, hectic lives!</li>
	</ul>
	<p>It is common for a feverish patient to lose their appetite. Part of the immune system&rsquo;s response is to shut down the digestive system in order to allow all energy to be directed towards fighting the &lsquo;attackers&rsquo;. Hence the saying: <q>Feed a cold and starve a fever.</q> Light food (fresh fruit, steamed vegetables etc.) is therefore all that is needed and, probably, wanted. Older babies who are still breastfed will probably only want breast for the duration of the illness &ndash; it gives them liquid, nutrition and great snuggle time!</p>
	<p>Many cases of childhood fevers start with the child vomiting. This is not necessarily a sign of a stomach bug, but the body&rsquo;s attempt to clear out the stomach so it doesn&rsquo;t have to &lsquo;waste&rsquo; any energy dealing with digestion. Vomiting can also occur later during the illness, when a feverish child has eaten a meal that was too rich or too much for the system.</p>
	<p>A word about febrile convulsions &ndash; feared by all parents of young children: According to the NHS website (<a href="#n1">1</a>), it is estimated that 1 in 20 children (5%) will have at least one febrile convulsion at some point, with most cases occurring between the ages of 6 months and 3 years. However, other websites state the risk as far lower, e.g. 3 in 100 children (3%) (<a href="#n2">2</a>).</p>
	<p>Most commonly, febrile convulsions occur as single incidents during any one illness or even the whole of childhood. Almost all children recover quickly from a febrile convulsion, though it is likely that the illness causing the fever in the first place might still need treatment. Febrile convulsions are extremely rare after the age of 5 or 6.</p>
	<p>Febrile convulsions can look very similar to epilepsy, but they are not the same. There is no clear evidence that febrile convulsions lead to the development of epilepsy in later life (<a href="#n3">3</a>) and there is no clear understanding why febrile convulsions develop in the first place. It appears not so much related to how high the body temperature goes but maybe how quickly the temperature rises, because many children have high temperatures without ever getting febrile convulsions.</p>
	<p>So, unless the patient is not coping or the fever is prolonged, no medication (not even homeopathic remedies!) might be needed at all! However, common sense and parents natural instincts should always be followed.</p>
	<p>There are a number of homeopathic remedies that should be considered in cases of fever and can be used before or, if necessary, in conjunction with paracetamol or ibuprofen. Miranda Castro, author of The Handbook of Homeopathy and Homeopathy for Mother and Children, describes them on her website http://www.mirandacastro.com/articles/fever_in_children.html. You can compare the information with this website too: <a href="http://health.hpathy.com/fever-symptoms-treatment-cure.asp">http://health.hpathy.com/fever-symptoms-treatment-cure.asp</a>.</p>

	<h2>Spring Delights &ndash; and Pains</h2>

	<p>Hopefully you will have had the opportunity to enjoy some of the spring sunshine already. Or maybe you are planning a spell over the Easter holidays to get out and about or to work in the garden.</p>

	<p>After a long winter your muscles might not be used to the strain you are putting them under, from digging the veg patch or a long hike along the coastal path. A hot bath can do wonders to relax stiff muscles. Homeopathic <i>Arnica</i> is great too!</p>
	<figure class="fr">
		<img src="img/arnica.avif" alt="Arnica">
		<figcaption><i>Arnica</i></figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>Keynotes for using <i>Arnica</i>: Muscles feel bruised and sore; the whole body can ache to the degree that even the bed feels too hard. <i>Arnica</i> is the first remedy to think of for any bumps and bruises from injury. Taken internally in tablet form it can help to reduce swelling and pain. <i>Arnica</i> is also available in creams and massage oils, but do not use these on broken skin as they can cause an unpleasant skin reaction.</p>

	<p>Another remedy to keep in mind, especially when stiffness is the main feature, is <i>Rhus toxicodendron</i>.</p>

	<p>Keynotes for using <i>Rhus toxicodendron</i>: pain and stiffness of muscles, joints or back after over-exertion which is worse on first movement and gets better with continued movement. Then exhaustion might set in, however, the person needing <i>Rhus toxicodendron</i> will not be able to find a comfortable position and is inclined to move and wriggle a lot. The pain and stiffness is commonly much worse in cold, damp conditions and gets better with heat (hot bath, hot water bottle).</p>

	<p>If you have been unlucky enough to sprain or strain an ankle or other joint, use <i>Arnica</i> first (internally in tablet form) to reduce any swelling and then continue with taking <i>Ruta</i>.</p>

	<p>Keynotes for using <i>Ruta</i>: A great remedy to help heal cartilage, tendons, ligaments or the skin of bones (periosteum) after injury from overuse or accidents. The pain feels bruised, sore and aching and is better for rubbing and massage. There is a sensation of weariness and lameness and the affected limb can feel too weak to hold any weight &ndash; even a cup of tea can feel too heavy!</p>

	<p>Again, <i>Rhus toxicodendron</i> and <i>Ruta</i> are available in creams which can be applied locally to an injured and aching joint.</p>

	<p>Other remedies to keep in mind for injuries acquired outdoors (or indoors):</p>

	<p><i>Ledum</i>: Use for any puncture wound, e.g. from the garden fork, a dog bite or a rusty nail. These wounds can get nasty because they tend to be deep yet can heal over superficially quite quickly. <i>Ledum</i> taken internally in tablet form can help to heal these types of wound from within, with a greatly reduced risk of infection. Wounds requiring <i>Ledum</i> usually feel cool to the touch and there is a blueness to the surrounding area. The pain will be better for cold applications.</p>
	<figure class="fr">
		<img src="img/hypericum.avif" alt="Hypericum">
		<figcaption><i>Hypericum</i></figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p><i>Hypericum</i>: This is the Number 1 remedy for injuries to nerve-rich parts, like a fall on the coccyx or fingers squashed in the door. The pain is excruciating (as the nerves are actually damaged) and characteristically shoots up the limb or body rather than being localised. Consider taking <i>Arnica</i> after <i>Hypericum</i> if you suspect that bruising and swelling is present too.</p>

	<p><i>Calendula</i>: Grazes, cuts and abrasions that become inflamed or infected can all benefit from <i>Calendula</i> taken internally in tablet form. <i>Calendula</i> is a common ingredient in creams and ointments. As well as healing the skin it is also a good natural antiseptic.</p>

	<p>It won&rsquo;t be long until the insects are out too. One of the best homeopathic remedies for bee and wasp stings is <i>Apis</i>.</p>

	<p>Keynotes for using <i>Apis</i>: Insect bites that swell up quickly, are hot, red and painful; the skin can get stretched so much from the swelling that it looks almost glossy and shiny. There can be itching but the pain is too bad to scratch. The pain is much better for cold applications and worse for heat (e.g. getting warm in bed).</p>

	<p>The niggling itch from midge bites, ants or stinging nettles can be greatly relieved with <i>Ledum</i> herbal tincture applied topically. There are a number of aromatherapy oils which are renown for their insect-repelling properties. Personally I use Citronella oil with its lovely lemony smell. It needs to be diluted in a base oil (sunflower oil or almond oil etc.) as it can cause skin reactions if used neat.</p>

	<p>If you find that insects always go for you (whilst leaving your partner alone) and/or you react quite badly to them then I would recommend homeopathic constitutional treatment by a professional homeopath. This can help, over time, to reduce allergic reactions (like those to insect bites) and even the tendency to get bitten in the first place.</p>

	<h2>Hay Fever</h2>

	<p>Whilst it seems that summer may still be a long way off, the start of the hay fever season is approaching rapidly.</p>

	<p>Homeopathic remedies can provide speedy help without the side effects of ordinary antihistamines (drowsiness etc.). Below is a list of common remedies useful for hay fever. Remember that this is only a small choice and that as a professional homeopath I have more remedies available should the success with self help be limited.</p>

	<p>The real beauty of homeopathy lies in the constitutional treatment though: Many patients find that they develop less and less hay fever symptoms once they attend a professional homeopath for constitutional treatment. This type of treatment will usually take place away from the actual hay fever season.</p>

	<p><i>Allium cepa</i>: The hay fever is characterised by a profuse watery discharge from both eyes and nose. Especially the nose seems to be dripping constantly (&ldquo;like a faucet&rdquo;). The nasal discharge is acrid and may make the nose and the upper lip raw and sore. Often there is a frontal headache accompanying the hay fever. There usually is violent sneezing too. All symptoms are much better in the open air and worse in warm rooms and in the evenings.</p>

	<p><i>Arsenicum</i> hay fever presents with a burning watery discharge from both eyes and nose, with tickling building up to a sneeze. The hay fever is worse in the night, typically just after midnight. The patient will be restless and anxious and can appear very fastidious and demanding.</p>

	<p><i>Euphrasia</i> is particularly helpful when the eyes are becoming inflamed. They seem to be watering the whole time with burning and a lot of blinking. The eyelids are swollen and may be glued together in the mornings. There is a profuse but bland, watery discharge from the nose. There may be a bursting, throbbing headache. All symptoms are worse in the evening and better for open air, but the patient will dislike any wind or even light breezes.</p>

	<p><i>Gelsemium</i>: This type of hay fever is accompanied by an overwhelming feeling of drowsiness and weakness, almost like flu. The sneezing causes exhaustion. The patient feels weak and heavy and the eyelids may be drooping with heaviness.</p>

	<p><i>Lachesis</i>: The sneezing fits are worse after sleep. There is a headache and a dry stuffed sensation through the head, with a red puffy face and sore nostrils and lips. The throat can be sore and sensitive and the patient will not want any pressure around the neck, typically wearing an open neck top.</p>

	<p>A <i>Nux vomica</i> hay fever comes with sneezing fits and a lot of irritation in the nose, eyes and the whole face. The face feels hot. The itching extends down the throat to the larynx and trachea. The eyes are sensitive to light and the patient is very irritated, impatient and snappy. Nothing seems to go fast enough for them!</p>

	<p><i>Pulsatilla</i>: The discharges from the nose and eyes are bland and thick and often yellow or greenish. The eyes may be very itchy, which will be much relieved from cold applications. Although being chilly, the patient will feel much better for cold air, preferably from air conditioning, as it does not contain pollens.</p>

	<p><i>Sabadilla</i> is indicated when spasmodic, violent attacks of sneezing are the main symptoms of hay fever. The patient is extremely sensitive to odours and even thinking of the smell of flowers can set off a sneezing attack. The patient is very chilly and enjoys hot drinks. They are much worse being outside and like to wrap up in a warm room.</p>

	<p><i>Wyethia</i> is indicated in hay fever that comes with a marked dryness of the mouth and throat, causing tremendous itching, which may extend to the ears. The itching is so bad that the patient will try to scratch the palate by moving the tongue back and forth over it. They may bore with their fingers in their ears to relieve itching there.</p>

	<h2>Homeopathic Remedies for Travelling</h2>

	<p>Hopefully you will find this seasonal advice before you set off on your annual holiday. Here are a few useful tips and ideas to cope with the upsets that can make travelling unpleasant at times.</p>

	<h3>Anxiety and phobias about flying</h3>

	<p>Homeopathic remedies to consider:</p>
	<p><i>Arg nit</i>:<br> very restless, hurried and anxious; with diarrhoea; desires and feels better for fresh air; craves sweets which cause diarrhoea.</p>
	<p><i>Gelsemium</i>:<br> almost paralysed with fear; trembling; feels unable to move.</p>
	<p>Rescue Remedy: universal remedy to help with fear and panic.</p>

	<h3>Travel sickness</h3>

	<p>Ginger (crystallised or as tea) has a reputation of easing queasy tummies. Acupressure wrist bands are available in high street pharmacies and at airports and ferry ports.</p>
	<p>Homeopathic remedies to consider:</p>
	<p><i>Cocculus</i>:<br> travel sickness starts with feeling faint, chilly and lacking ability to think clearly; nausea much worse from any strong smells (avoid wearing perfumes); worse for lack of sleep; headache with retching.</p>

	<h3>Jetlag</h3>

	<p>To avoid jetlag, try taking <i>Arnica</i> 30c the night before travelling and, on long-haul flights, take at 6-hourly intervals throughout the flight.</p>
	<p>Avoid dehydration during the flight by drinking plenty of water or watered down fruit juices. Remember that alcohol, tea and coffee aggravate dehydration.</p>
	<p>Homeopathic remedies to consider:</p>
	<p><i>Cocculus</i>:<br> severely disturbed sleep with starting from sleep; feels exhausted, sluggish and cannot think clearly.</p>
	<p><i>Nux vomica</i>:<br> feeling of being hung over with irritability, nausea, tension headache and constipation.</p>
	<p><i>Gelsemium</i>:<br> tired, heavy limbs and almost paralytic weakness; disinclined to move.</p>

	<h3>Over-Exposure to Sun and Sunstroke</h3>

	<p>Homeopathic remedies to consider:</p>
	<p><i>Nat mur</i>:<br> cold sores from sun or from being at the seaside; heat rash/prickly heat from exposure to sun; generally sensitive to sun.</p>
	<p><i>Urtica urens</i>:<br> sunburn with itching; itchy skin eruptions (like nettle rash) from exposure to sun; can also be used externally as an ointment on sunburn or minor burns or scalds.</p>
	<p><i>Belladonna</i>:<br> sunburn with bright red, dry skin; throbbing headache; looking flushed; delirious from sunstroke.</p>

	<h3>Vomiting and Diarrhoea and Tummy Upset</h3>

	<p>Ensure that fluid intake is kept high to avoid dehydration.</p>

	<p>Homeopathic remedies to consider:</p>
	<p><i>Arsenicum</i>:<br> extreme prostration from vomiting or diarrhoea; when vomiting and diarrhoea occur together; extreme chilliness and needs warmth in any form (covers, radiator, hot drinks); very anxious and feels much better in company; vomiting and diarrhoea that start between midnight and 3 am.</p>
	<p><i>Veratrum</i>:<br> when vomiting and diarrhoea occur together; sudden, projectile vomiting; watery diarrhoea; sensation of icy-coldness in stomach before vomiting or diarrhoea; icy-cold sweat on forehead before vomiting or diarrhoea; desires cold drinks; involuntary stools.</p>
	<p><i>Carbo veg</i>:<br> bloated abdomen and extreme discomfort from trapped wind; constant belching and burping; severe cramping pains and diarrhoea with a state of near-collapse; cannot bear tight clothing esp. around waist; desires fresh, cool air and to be fanned.</p>
	<p><i>China</i>:<br> if weakness and prostration remain after body fluids have been lost due to vomiting and diarrhoea.</p>
	<p><i>Nux vomica</i>:<br> hang-over from too much alcohol or over-indulgence in rich food; constipation with ineffectual urging and straining, with cramping pains; very irritable, over-sensitive and impatient.</p>

	<h3>Altitude Sickness</h3>

	<p>The homeopathic remedy <i>Coca</i> can be helpful but must be ordered from a homoeopathic pharmacy. Request labelling as <q>Altitude Remedy</q> or similar to avoid hassle at airports.</p>

	<h3>Remedies to consider for general self-help situations</h3>

	<p>For insect bites see the section <em>Spring Delights &ndash; and Pains</em>.</p>

	<p>If you should suffer a small wound like a cut or graze, wash the wound out immediately with water or boiled water which has been allowed to cool down. <i>Hypericum</i> and <i>Calendula</i> solution can be added to cooled boiled water and is a good antiseptic to clean wounds. Once the bleeding has stopped, generally it is sufficient to keep the wound clean and just cover it lightly (or not at all) to allow the wound to dry out and heal. In very hot countries a wound can go from infected and inflamed to very angry-looking in no time at all.</p>

	<p>Take <i>Arnica</i> immediately to reduce any swelling and pain and then continue with <i>Calendula</i> and <i>Hypericum</i> as internal remedies to promote healing and to help to keep the wound infection-free.</p>

	<h2>Back to School</h2>
	<p>September sees the return to routines after the long summer break. Return to school is a time of excitement for most &ndash; and worries for some. Starting school, changing school or even just changing classroom settings with new teachers can prove difficult for many youngsters. The stresses of long days and academic workload can lead to a lowered immune system, with coughs and colds starting to creep in.</p>
	<p>Anxiety about starting or changing school is normal, but for some children the stress can be overwhelming. For those starting for the first time, they will have to become more independent, sit still for long periods, take instructions given to the whole class and cope with what can be the frightening hustle and bustle of the playground. Older kids moving into secondary school often feel overwhelmed and intimidated by the sheer size of their new school.</p>
	<p>Kids who struggle can develop a whole range of problems. These can be physical, like for example tummy aches or headaches, or behavioural, ranging from clinginess, problems with sleeping, to nightmares and aggression.</p>
	<p>The obvious first measures are always to ensure the child has sufficient emotional support and eats healthy food. Young children may well need more sleep during the initial months, so early bedtime routines could be helpful.</p>
	<p>Homeopathic remedies can be used at home to help youngsters through the difficult transition period. In selecting a remedy, individual characteristics are taken into consideration. Here are just a few remedies and their situations which might be useful.</p>
	<p><i>Argentum nitricum</i>:<br> a child needing this remedy will be hurried, with lots of fears and anxieties, always asking &ldquo;what if&hellip;&rdquo; Physical symptoms include loud wind, twitching, diarrhoea and periodic weakness.</p>
	<p><i>Arsenicum</i>:<br> this child is restless, fears failure, worries about burglars and their health, won&rsquo;t be left alone, likes to plan and tidies up after themselves. Physical symptoms include: diarrhoea from anxiety, with thirst, has trouble swallowing food, and burning pains.</p>
	<p><i>Lycopodium</i>:<br> this child will lack confidence and doesn&rsquo;t like doing new things, but can be assertive and bossy at home. Physical symptoms include bloating, huge appetite, heartburn with sour burping and waking as if from a fright.</p>
	<p><i>Silica</i>:<br> this child is nervous, sensitive and excitable and lacks confidence, with a fear of new things. They can be obstinate, with fixed ideas. Physical symptoms include cracked dry skin, cutting abdominal pain with rumbling and headache which extends to forehead and settles over one eye.</p>
	<p>If these remedies do not have the desired effect then a visit to a qualified homeopath may well provide the opportunity for the child to move through their problems and to begin to enjoy school more fully.</p>

	<h2>The Cold Season has started</h2>
	<p>The nights are drawing in, the days are colder and wetter &ndash; coughs and colds are beginning to make the rounds.</p>
	<p>Most common colds are unproblematic and, with some common sense measures, will last only a few days. Drinking plenty of fluids, eating fresh fruit and vegetables, following the body&rsquo;s needs for rest and early nights will usually avoid the need to take any form of medication, even homeopathic remedies.</p>
	<p>When colds are drawn out, have painful sinus involvement or sore throats, or go to the chest, then homeopathic remedies can be used to support.</p>
	<p>As always, if symptoms persist then it is necessary to consult with a qualified homeopath or health practitioner. For recurring colds, coughs or sore throats it will be necessary to see a qualified homeopath for supportive constitutional treatment.</p>
	<p>The following remedies can be tried in self-help. The remedies are listed for the different ailments but I would recommend that you look through all, as most cover more than one ailment. As ever, the better the match of symptoms the more of a chance that the remedy will help.</p>
	<h3>Colds</h3>
	<p>
		<i>Aconite</i><br>The number one remedy for a cold that comes on suddenly after exposure to cold, dry wind. This remedy needs to be taken at first signs of a cold with maybe a sore throat and a clear runny nasal discharge. Once the cold has settled and the nose is more blocked or thicker discharges are present then a different remedy needs to be looked for.</p>
	<p>
		<i>Arsenicum</i><br>There is a burning, watery discharge from the nose. The nose might be dripping whilst being blocked up at the same time. There is sneezing that doesn&rsquo;t give any relief. The nasal discharge is acrid and the nose will look red and sore. This person will feel extremely cold and shivery. They will be sitting by a warm radiator or fire, whilst sipping from a hot drink.</p>
	<p>
		<i>Gelsemium</i><br>This is the Number 1 remedy for flu. Symptoms take a while to come on, with feeling under the weather for a few days. There is heaviness in all muscles and even the eyelids are drooping. There is usually a dull headache at the back of the head. Once the flu has developed there is aching in the muscles and fevers with chills that run up and down the spine and cause shivering.</p>
	<p>
		<i>Natrum muriaticum</i><br>There is a feeling as if the whole head is blocked up, like a typical head cold. The blocked up feeling alternates with streaming nasal discharges, which are running like a tap. There is a feeling of dryness of all the membranes and the lips become dry and cracked. Cold sores are very common. The patient is reserved and doesn&rsquo;t like to be fussed over. They are likely to feel better in fresh air.</p>
	<p>
		<i>Nux vomica</i><br>Blocked nose alternating with discharges and sneezing. The teeth may ache. They are thirsty and chilly and better for resting. However, they are very impatient and ill-tempered and may be tempted to take any medicine going, just to be able to get back to work (or play) more quickly. The cold might have come on from over-working, or the individual can generally be described as a workaholic.</p>
	<h3>Sinus problems</h3>
	<p>
		<i>Kali bich</i><br>This is the Number 1 remedy for painful sinuses with difficult, stringy nasal catarrh. Mucous discharges tend to be green and nasty smelling. The pain is exquisite and often in a very localised area &ndash; the person needing <i>Kali bich</i> can literally put the finger on it, and pressure will usually alleviate the pain.</p>
	<p>
		<i>Hepar sulph</i><br>The whole area of the sinuses is very painful, with thick, yellow-green catarrh. The nose is obstructed and the whole front of the head feels congested and heavy. Inhaling cold air aggravates the sinus pain badly. This person is very touchy and irritable.</p>
	<h3>Sore Throat</h3>
	<p>
		<i>Belladonna</i><br>Sudden onset of a sore throat with fever. The throat is bright red and inflamed looking. There is a burning pain on swallowing. Usually the right side is affected first or worst. The fever can go quite high, with a dry burning heat and a flushed face.</p>
	<p>
		<i>Hepar sulph</i><br>The pain in the throat is exquisitely sharp and feels like a fish-bone is stuck in there. Tonsils might be affected with ulceration and an offensive smell. Any cold (air, drink, food) will aggravate whilst keeping warm will give some amelioration. They will usually want to cover the throat and neck area with something warm. They are touchy and irritable.</p>
	<p>
		<i>Mercurius</i><br>The glands are swollen and the tonsils are affected and ulcerated. Key indications for this remedy are profuse saliva and offensive smelling breath. There may be a bitter, metallic taste in the mouth. The pains are sore, raw and burning or can feel like a splinter stuck in the throat. Both hot or cold make the pain much worse.</p>
	<h3>Coughs</h3>
	<p>Frankincense essential oil can help a tickly cough and may well be all that is needed for a good night&rsquo;s sleep. Just place a couple of drops on a handkerchief and place it somewhere in the room.</p>
	<p>
		<i>Bryonia</i><br>A dry, hacking cough from tickling in the throat. There is a great sense of dryness of the back of the throat and the air passages. Often there is pain with the cough, in the chest and in the head. The person suffering from this type of cough will try to be as still as possible. When coughing they will hold their chest firmly, similarly they will hold the head if there is associated headache.</p>
	<p>
		<i>Phosphorus</i><br>Every cold goes to the chest. The cough is loose and dry in alteration, with yellowish phlegm. There is a burning pain in the chest and a tickling in the throat. Talking and laughing will set off a bout of coughing, as will a change of temperature like going from a warm room into the cold outside.</p>
	<p>
		<i>Pulsatilla</i><br>The cough is usually associated with a cold and possibly catarrh in the throat. There is a dry cough that starts at night in bed on becoming warm, disturbing sleep and possibly ending in retching. In the morning the cough is loose, with yellow-greenish expectoration. This person will feel much better for fresh air. They tend to feel weepy or, in the case of children, will become clingy and whiny.</p>
	<p>Asthma and other chronic chest problems will need to be prescribed for by a professional homeopath.</p>

	<h2>Homeopathic Remedies to Help You Through the Festive Season</h2>
	<p>While the festive season undoubtedly brings cheer and goodwill, the stocking fillers can include stress, the after effects of over-indulgence and the January blues.</p>
	<p>Asked privately, many of the UK workforce will probably admit to taking time off for a hangover-induced sickie, and half a million people suffering from Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) (<a href="#n1">1</a>) in the dark winter months. Hence, many people are looking for some holistic help.</p>
	<p>Homeopathy, a holistic system of medicine which is based on treating the individual with highly diluted substances given in mainly tablet form, has been used for more than 200 years, with the last two decades seeing a resurgence as interest in complementary and alternative medicine grows (<a href="#n2">2</a>).</p>
	<p>Homeopathic remedies trigger the body&rsquo;s natural system of healing and are selected based on a patient&rsquo;s experience of their symptoms, rather than based on the named condition. For deeper chronic conditions, emotional problems or mental health issues, a consultation with a fully qualified homeopath is recommended. But for short-lived acute conditions, it&rsquo;s possible to use remedies at home.</p>
	<p>Here are just a few remedies which might help you through the downside of the festive period:</p>
	<p><i>Nux vomica:</i><br>Known by some patients as &ldquo;the hangover&rdquo; remedy, <i>Nux vomica:</i> can also be used for the general symptoms of digestive over-indulgence. Symptoms include nausea, headache, sensitivity to noise and light and irritability. Particularly suits people who tend to burn the candle at both ends, keep going with coffee and feel the cold.</p>
	<p><i>Arsenicum:</i><br>May help with the symptoms of food poisoning, with vomiting and diarrhoea, a deathly pallor and anxiety. Could also be used when the diarrhoea is anxiety-induced, worse at night with burning in the stomach and a desire to sip water. It suits restless people who are fearful worriers, need to plan and feel the cold.</p>
	<p><i>Sulphur:</i><br>Symptoms include offensive diarrhoea which drives the patient from bed in the morning, excessive sweating, and burning feet. Suits stubborn people who need praise, worry about their health, can be peevish with lots of big ideas they find difficult to actualise. They crave sugar and spicy food.</p>
	<p><i>Lycopodium:</i><br>Symptoms include bloating with wind, a huge appetite, and waking as if from a fright. There is heartburn with sour burping. Suits fearful people lacking in confidence but can be bragging and assertive at home. Doesn&rsquo;t like undertaking new things.</p>
	<p><i>Arnica:</i><br>Don&rsquo;t forget this great remedy to help with bruising and that &ldquo;battered&rdquo; feeling you get after Christmas shopping or bargain hunting in the January sales!</p>
