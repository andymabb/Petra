<h2>Homeopathic Remedies to Help You Through the Festive Season</h2>
	<p>While the festive season undoubtedly brings cheer and goodwill, the stocking fillers can include stress, the after effects of over-indulgence and the January blues.</p>
	<p>Asked privately, many of the UK workforce will probably admit to taking time off for a hangover-induced sickie, and half a million people suffering from Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) (<a href="#n1">1</a>) in the dark winter months. Hence, many people are looking for some holistic help.</p>
	<p>Homeopathy, a holistic system of medicine which is based on treating the individual with highly diluted substances given in mainly tablet form, has been used for more than 200 years, with the last two decades seeing a resurgence as interest in complementary and alternative medicine grows (<a href="#n2">2</a>).</p>
	<p>Homeopathic remedies trigger the body&rsquo;s natural system of healing and are selected based on a patient&rsquo;s experience of their symptoms, rather than based on the named condition. For deeper chronic conditions, emotional problems or mental health issues, a consultation with a fully qualified homeopath is recommended. But for short-lived acute conditions, it&rsquo;s possible to use remedies at home.</p>
	<p>Here are just a few remedies which might help you through the downside of the festive period:</p>
	<p><i>Nux vomica:</i><br>Known by some patients as &ldquo;the hangover&rdquo; remedy, <i>Nux vomica:</i> can also be used for the general symptoms of digestive over-indulgence. Symptoms include nausea, headache, sensitivity to noise and light and irritability. Particularly suits people who tend to burn the candle at both ends, keep going with coffee and feel the cold.</p>
	<p><i>Arsenicum:</i><br>May help with the symptoms of food poisoning, with vomiting and diarrhoea, a deathly pallor and anxiety. Could also be used when the diarrhoea is anxiety-induced, worse at night with burning in the stomach and a desire to sip water. It suits restless people who are fearful worriers, need to plan and feel the cold.</p>
	<p><i>Sulphur:</i><br>Symptoms include offensive diarrhoea which drives the patient from bed in the morning, excessive sweating, and burning feet. Suits stubborn people who need praise, worry about their health, can be peevish with lots of big ideas they find difficult to actualise. They crave sugar and spicy food.</p>
	<p><i>Lycopodium:</i><br>Symptoms include bloating with wind, a huge appetite, and waking as if from a fright. There is heartburn with sour burping. Suits fearful people lacking in confidence but can be bragging and assertive at home. Doesn&rsquo;t like undertaking new things.</p>
	<p><i>Arnica:</i><br>Don&rsquo;t forget this great remedy to help with bruising and that &ldquo;battered&rdquo; feeling you get after Christmas shopping or bargain hunting in the January sales!</p>
