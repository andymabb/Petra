<h2>Homeopathic Remedies for Travelling</h2>

	<p>Hopefully you will find this seasonal advice before you set off on your annual holiday. Here are a few useful tips and ideas to cope with the upsets that can make travelling unpleasant at times.</p>

	<h3>Anxiety and phobias about flying</h3>

	<p>Homeopathic remedies to consider:</p>

	<h3>Travel sickness</h3>

	<p>Ginger (crystallised or as tea) has a reputation of easing queasy tummies. Acupressure wrist bands are available in high street pharmacies and at airports and ferry ports.</p>

	<h3>Jetlag</h3>

	<p>To avoid jetlag, try taking <i>Arnica</i> 30c the night before travelling and, on long-haul flights, take at 6-hourly intervals throughout the flight.</p>
	<p>Avoid dehydration during the flight by drinking plenty of water or watered down fruit juices. Remember that alcohol, tea and coffee aggravate dehydration.</p>

	<h3>Vomiting and Diarrhoea and Tummy Upset</h3>

	<p>Homeopathic remedies to consider:</p>
	<p><i>Arsenicum</i>:<br> extreme prostration from vomiting or diarrhoea; when vomiting and diarrhoea occur together; extreme chilliness and needs warmth in any form (covers, radiator, hot drinks); very anxious and feels much better in company; vomiting and diarrhoea that start between midnight and 3 am.</p>

	<p><i>China</i>:<br> if weakness and prostration remain after body fluids have been lost due to vomiting and diarrhoea.</p>
	<p><i>Nux vomica</i>:<br> hang-over from too much alcohol or over-indulgence in rich food; constipation with ineffectual urging and straining, with cramping pains; very irritable, over-sensitive and impatient.</p>

	<h3>Altitude Sickness</h3>

	<p>The homeopathic remedy <i>Coca</i> can be helpful but must be ordered from a homoeopathic pharmacy. Request labelling as <q>Altitude Remedy</q> or similar to avoid hassle at airports.</p>

	<h3>Remedies to consider for general self-help situations</h3>

	<p>For insect bites see the section <em>Spring Delights &ndash; and Pains</em>.</p>

	<p>If you should suffer a small wound like a cut or graze, wash the wound out immediately with water or boiled water which has been allowed to cool down. <i>Hypericum</i> and <i>Calendula</i> solution can be added to cooled boiled water and is a good antiseptic to clean wounds. Once the bleeding has stopped, generally it is sufficient to keep the wound clean and just cover it lightly (or not at all) to allow the wound to dry out and heal. In very hot countries a wound can go from infected and inflamed to very angry-looking in no time at all.</p>

	<p>Take <i>Arnica</i> immediately to reduce any swelling and pain and then continue with <i>Calendula</i> and <i>Hypericum</i> as internal remedies to promote healing and to help to keep the wound infection-free.</p>
