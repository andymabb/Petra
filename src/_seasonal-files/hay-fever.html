<h2>Hay Fever</h2>

	<p>Whilst it seems that summer may still be a long way off, the start of the hay fever season is approaching rapidly.</p>

	<p>Homeopathic remedies can provide speedy help without the side effects of ordinary antihistamines (drowsiness etc.). Below is a list of common remedies useful for hay fever. Remember that this is only a small choice and that as a professional homeopath I have more remedies available should the success with self help be limited.</p>

	<p>The real beauty of homeopathy lies in the constitutional treatment though: Many patients find that they develop less and less hay fever symptoms once they attend a professional homeopath for constitutional treatment. This type of treatment will usually take place away from the actual hay fever season.</p>

	<p><i>Allium cepa</i>: The hay fever is characterised by a profuse watery discharge from both eyes and nose. Especially the nose seems to be dripping constantly (&ldquo;like a faucet&rdquo;). The nasal discharge is acrid and may make the nose and the upper lip raw and sore. Often there is a frontal headache accompanying the hay fever. There usually is violent sneezing too. All symptoms are much better in the open air and worse in warm rooms and in the evenings.</p>

	<p><i>Arsenicum</i> hay fever presents with a burning watery discharge from both eyes and nose, with tickling building up to a sneeze. The hay fever is worse in the night, typically just after midnight. The patient will be restless and anxious and can appear very fastidious and demanding.</p>

	<p><i>Euphrasia</i> is particularly helpful when the eyes are becoming inflamed. They seem to be watering the whole time with burning and a lot of blinking. The eyelids are swollen and may be glued together in the mornings. There is a profuse but bland, watery discharge from the nose. There may be a bursting, throbbing headache. All symptoms are worse in the evening and better for open air, but the patient will dislike any wind or even light breezes.</p>

	<p><i>Gelsemium</i>: This type of hay fever is accompanied by an overwhelming feeling of drowsiness and weakness, almost like flu. The sneezing causes exhaustion. The patient feels weak and heavy and the eyelids may be drooping with heaviness.</p>

	<p><i>Lachesis</i>: The sneezing fits are worse after sleep. There is a headache and a dry stuffed sensation through the head, with a red puffy face and sore nostrils and lips. The throat can be sore and sensitive and the patient will not want any pressure around the neck, typically wearing an open neck top.</p>

	<p>A <i>Nux vomica</i> hay fever comes with sneezing fits and a lot of irritation in the nose, eyes and the whole face. The face feels hot. The itching extends down the throat to the larynx and trachea. The eyes are sensitive to light and the patient is very irritated, impatient and snappy. Nothing seems to go fast enough for them!</p>

	<p><i>Pulsatilla</i>: The discharges from the nose and eyes are bland and thick and often yellow or greenish. The eyes may be very itchy, which will be much relieved from cold applications. Although being chilly, the patient will feel much better for cold air, preferably from air conditioning, as it does not contain pollens.</p>

	<p><i>Sabadilla</i> is indicated when spasmodic, violent attacks of sneezing are the main symptoms of hay fever. The patient is extremely sensitive to odours and even thinking of the smell of flowers can set off a sneezing attack. The patient is very chilly and enjoys hot drinks. They are much worse being outside and like to wrap up in a warm room.</p>

	<p><i>Wyethia</i> is indicated in hay fever that comes with a marked dryness of the mouth and throat, causing tremendous itching, which may extend to the ears. The itching is so bad that the patient will try to scratch the palate by moving the tongue back and forth over it. They may bore with their fingers in their ears to relieve itching there.</p>
